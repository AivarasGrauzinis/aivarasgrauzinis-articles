# Aivaras A Grauzinis

I trained as an **engineer** but spent three decades exploring the edges between science and art—industrial design, special‑effects prototyping, 3‑D modelling, and most recently **digital photography & computational imaging**.

A turning point came when multiple sclerosis limited my motor abilities. I stepped back from corporate design, yet art proved far more adaptable than CAD work—so I leaned in. Today I work primarily as an **artist‑photographer and author**, translating scientific curiosity into visuals and essays.

I publish regularly on **Medium** (5 500 + followers) where I examine AI ethics, prompt engineering, and the philosophy of mind—including whether our tests for “intelligence” are simply a mirror held up to ourselves.

## What I’m working on

* **Emergent Minds** — essays on anthropocentrism and AI cognition ([latest](/2025/07/19/ai-and-anthropocentrism.html)).
* **Fractal‑Cicloyd prints** — photorealistic fractal structures rendered in Midjourney, finished with physical mixed‑media techniques.
* **Adaptive Workflows** — tooling that lets disabled creators offload repetitive tasks to AI (the workflow powering this very site).
