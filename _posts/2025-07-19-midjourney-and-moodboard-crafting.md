In the previous , I mentioned how it could be possible to make a new moodboard starting with one interesting image. Today, I wanted to elaborate on that process and show the results.

Catching interesting styles and visual interpretations and making moodboards out of them became a second nature for me and an irreplaceable tool in my workflow.

Creating an interesting and useful moodboard does not take either that much time, nor big effort, but it can pay back tenfold when crafting your unique images. So the effort is well worth it.

In this specific case, the moodboard started with a single image created with this prompt:

“Improbable architecture — chaos 60 — ar 2:1 — profile vaatt5s hx4q7fd”

I really liked that image. This Ink Wash & Line Work,  executed in thin, delicate ink lines combined with washes of diluted black ink, implies a sketchy, fragmented, and spontaneous blend of abstract expressionism and conceptual drawing.

There’s a tension between the stark white emptiness and the dense black scribbles, a pull between nothingness and overcrowded presence. It feels like a place that’s both decaying and under construction, a sketch of something grand that time or imagination has not finished working on yet.

What holds this image together is not symmetry, nor balance, but a kind of gravitational pull towards the side where the structures thicken, swell, and almost collapse under their own weight.

The ink bleeds downward, as if the city is leaking into some unseen depth, or trying to escape its own outline. The emptiness around it isn’t blank space; it’s charged with the suggestion of everything that isn’t shown; it is a space for imagination.

So, the question is: can I preserve all those qualities that I liked and make all that into a moodboard?

I think I can. Maybe not everything, but a lot of stuff that made this image so exciting for me should be possible to capture. And then, with time, I can perfect the moodboard.

But I have to start somewhere, and I start by making variations of my initial image. I use the “Vary Strong” button with Midjourney V7.

As you can see, all four variations turned out similar in details and style, which is what we need. So I make variations of each of these four images, too.

At this point, I am making images that are closely reminiscent of each other, but that is a good thing: it will be easier for Midjourney to figure out what I am interested in when I make a moodboard.

When I am making variations, I am watching closely the style elements in each image. And if Midjourney starts to drift away from the style I like, it is time to change tactics.

I return to my original image prompt, add that first image as a style reference, and run the prompt again.

New images will likely have the style elements I wanted. And I can make variations of all those that did.

My goal is to create 20 or so images containing the style I like, so I can start building a moodboard. But, before I add these images to my new moodboard, I upscale them.

Moddboards are rather sensitive to image quality. If you add poor-quality, low-resolution images to the moodboard, their low quality will propagate. I had observed how even low-quality JPG artefacts like block structure and noise propagate to newly generated images.

From the point of view of the moodboard, these quality artifacts are indistinguishable from style features. So it is a wise move to feed moodboards only with the highest quality images, especially if you are working with a style where fine detail matters.

Once I have my miniature moodboard with 20 or so images ready, I can start using it as reinforcement in my original prompt, or carefully craft new prompts for it.

My initial images selected for the moodboard concentrated on style, but not on variety. It is safe to say that this moodboard is not very stable yet and will not perform that well with a wide variety of subject matter.

Now it is time to work on that. It is best to work incrementally, first creating something similar in nature, yet different enough to expand the scope of the moodboard.

I started with the forest at the lake, which, topologically speaking, could be similar to my architectural images, yet benefits from the same style.

That worked quite well, and after making a few variations, upscaling and adding them to my moodboard, I proceeded with a tropical island, city traffic, old bridge in the mist - all expanding the scope of the moodboard, yet not stretching the style too far.

Once I collect 50 or so images in my new moodboard, I can proceed with less caution. By now, it is stable and robust enough to handle a larger variety of subjects.

Still, I often enough use the original image as a style reference in the prompt, to remind Midjourney what I am really after.

After you reach a 100-image mark in your moodboard, you can consider it finished, provided you were diligent and thorough enough in selecting your images. I have a few moodboard with way more than 100 images in them, but these are more of an exception than the rule.

And I would like to say that this is it, the work is done. And for most people, it is.

But I never stop tweaking my moodboards. Removing images, adding images, experimenting. But that’s just a technicality.

The real work starts when the moodboard is finished and I start learning how to use it. For me, moodboard are like a painter's brush or another tube of paint. It is an ingredient to be used with many others in the process of creating my art. Not Midjourney’s images, but my recognisable, different art.

And this specific moodboard turned out to be a powerful tool I learned how to use it in a few ways already, but I am sure I will find many more ways in the future. For now, I’ll let the images below speak for themselves.
